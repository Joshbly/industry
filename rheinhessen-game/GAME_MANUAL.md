# RHEINHESSEN INDUSTRIEWERK GmbH
## The Official Game Manual

### Welcome to the Industrial Revolution

In the heart of Germany's Rheinhessen region, four competing industrial corporations vie for market dominance. As CEO of your corporation, you'll navigate the delicate balance between aggressive production and regulatory compliance. Every decision matters: push too hard and face crushing audits; play too safe and watch competitors surge ahead.

This is not merely a card game—it's a battle of nerves, calculation, and strategic timing where fortunes can shift with a single audit.

## THE CORPORATE BATTLEFIELD

  - **The Opportunist**: A cunning rival who strikes when others are vulnerable

### Game Setup

- **4 players**: You versus three AI-controlled corporations
- **Starting hand**: Each player draws 7 cards
- **Victory threshold**: First to reach 300 points wins

## FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS

### The Factory Floor
Your factory floor displays your production output—cards laid down during production phases. This is public information; competitors can see what you're producing and assess your vulnerability to audits. High-value illegal productions attract attention and suspicion.

### Production Classifications

#### Legal Production (Government-Approved)
Exact poker hands that meet regulatory standards:
- **Pair**: Two cards of same rank (e.g., 8♠ 8♥)
- **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., 8♠ 8♥ 5♣ 5♦)
- **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of same rank
- **Straight**: Five sequential ranks (includes A-2-3-4-5)
- **Flush**: Five cards of same suit
- **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair
- **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of same rank
- **Straight Flush**: Five sequential ranks of same suit

**Legal Benefits**: 70% of raw value + 8 compliance bonus points

#### Illegal Production (Off-the-Books)
Any combination that doesn't form an exact poker hand. While potentially lucrative, illegal production carries serious risks:
- **Base Rate**: 60% of raw value
- **The Danger Zone**: Productions worth 27+ raw value:
  - Lose 5 points in kickbacks
  - Add audit ticks to the track
  - Draw regulatory attention

### The Audit Track
Five boxes representing regulatory scrutiny. As illegal activities accumulate, the track fills:
- **0-2 Ticks**: Safe zone, business as usual
- **3 Ticks**: High alert—further violations add 2 ticks instead of 1
- **4 Ticks**: Critical—next violation triggers External Audit
- **5 Ticks**: EXTERNAL AUDIT TRIGGERED

### External Audit Consequences
When triggered, government inspectors descend on all factories:
1. All corporations must reorganize their factory floors
2. Inspectors salvage whatever legal productions they can find
3. Remaining illegal cards incur double fines
4. The corporation that triggered the audit loses 20 additional points
5. Audit track resets to zero

## TURN STRUCTURE

Each turn consists of three phases, executed in strict order:

### Phase 1: DRAW (Mandatory)
Draw 2 cards from the deck. Information is power—more cards mean more options.

### Phase 2: INTERNAL AUDIT (Optional)
Before producing, you may audit ONE competitor's factory floor:
1. Select a rival corporation
2. Their factory floor is examined for illegal content
3. They must reorganize, keeping only legitimate productions
4. Leftover illegal cards generate fines (double the standard rate)
5. You gain strategic advantage by disrupting their operations

**Strategic Consideration**: Internal audits are powerful weapons. Time them when opponents have accumulated significant illegal production but before they can legitimize their operations.

### Phase 3: PRODUCE or PASS
Choose one:
- **Produce Legal**: Play an exact poker hand for guaranteed profit
- **Produce Illegal**: Play any other combination (risk vs. reward)
- **Pass**: Sometimes the wisest move is patience

---

## SCORING MATHEMATICS

### Card Values
- Number cards (2-10): Face value
- Jack, Queen, King: 10 points each
- Ace: 11 points

### Production Formulas
- **Legal**: (Raw Value × 0.70) + 8
- **Illegal (Safe, ≤26)**: Raw Value × 0.60
- **Illegal (Dangerous, ≥27)**: (Raw Value × 0.60) - 5

### Audit Penalties
- **Internal Audit Leftover**: Raw Value × 1.40 (fined from victim)
- **External Audit Leftover**: Raw Value × 1.40 (double penalty)

## STRATEGIC MASTERY

### Early Game (0-100 Points)
Establish your production engine. Mix legal and safe illegal productions. The audit track is forgiving—use this freedom wisely.

### Mid Game (100-200 Points)
Monitor the audit track obsessively. At 3+ ticks, pivot to legal production unless you're positioning for an audit strike. Watch for opponents hoarding illegal production.

### Late Game (200-300 Points)
Every decision is critical. A well-timed internal audit can devastate a leader. Balance aggression with survival—triggering an external audit near victory can be catastrophic.

### Advanced Tactics

#### The Audit Trap
Accumulate moderate illegal production, baiting opponents to audit you when your floor is actually manageable. They waste their audit while you maintain momentum.

#### The Spike Play
When the audit track is at 4, opponents fear triggering external audit. This is your moment—play aggressive illegal productions while others play conservatively.

#### The Cleaner
After others have spiked the audit track to 3-4, switch entirely to legal production. Let aggressive opponents trigger the external audit while you emerge unscathed.

#### Reading AI Opponents
- **Aggressor**: Vulnerable to audits, often holds massive illegal stockpiles
- **Conservative**: Rarely worth auditing, but predictable and slower
- **Balanced**: Adapts to audit track—audit them at 2-3 ticks
- **Opportunist**: Dangerous when you're vulnerable—keep your floor clean when they're next

## THE PSYCHOLOGY OF RHEINHESSEN

### Risk Assessment
Every illegal production is a calculated gamble. The question isn't whether to break the rules—it's when and how much. A corporation that never takes risks will be outpaced by those who do.

### Information Warfare
Your factory floor is visible, but your hand is hidden. Use this asymmetry. A large factory floor might deter audits (too much to reorganize efficiently) or invite them (too tempting a target).

### The Audit Dance
The audit track creates a fascinating prisoner's dilemma. Everyone benefits from keeping it low, but individual incentive pushes toward dangerous production. The corporation that best navigates this tension will dominate.

### Timing Is Everything
A 40-point illegal production is brilliant at audit track 1, acceptable at track 2, risky at track 3, and potentially suicidal at track 4. Context transforms every decision.

## VICTORY CONDITIONS

### Standard Victory
First corporation to reach 300 points claims market dominance.

### Deck Exhaustion
If the deck runs out:
- Complete the current round (all players get equal turns)
- Highest score wins
- Ties broken by lowest illegal production on factory floor

## YOUR FIRST GAME

Start with these guidelines:
1. **Turns 1-5**: Draw cards, build your hand, play safe illegal (≤26) or small legal
2. **Watch the AI**: Notice how each persona behaves differently
3. **First Audit**: Try an internal audit when an opponent has 30+ points on their floor
4. **Track Awareness**: When audit track hits 3, shift toward legal production
5. **Endgame**: Balance speed with safety—don't trigger external audit when winning
